# To Do Application
- To Do List Manager Phase 1: Begin the build of an application designed for creating and organizing a “To Do” list in your browser.
- To Do List Manager Phase 2: Connecting the To Do Application to an external API and Database

## About Process
- In the first phase, we’re going to have to start by converting a legacy application into a more modern architecture. Our initial “Proof of Concept” was written using class based components and was not properly styled. Now that our client has given us the “green light” for development, we’re going to refactor the application using Hooks and upgrading the style. 
- In the second phase, we’ll be connecting our application to an API so that our list will be saved permanently. This will require a working and deployed API server with a proper “To Do” data model and appropriate REST routes
